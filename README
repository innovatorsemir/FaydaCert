## Docker Support

This project includes Docker configuration files (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`) to help containerize the app.

### Current status

- The app works fine when run locally with `npm run dev`.
- Docker support is under development â€” the app may not fully work inside Docker yet.
- Issues encountered include connection errors to MongoDB inside Docker and port conflicts.
- Contributions and suggestions to improve Dockerization are welcome!

### Running locally (no Docker)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
